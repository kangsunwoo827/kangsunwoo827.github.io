  Hello! This page is my homepage. I will be post about my days and my thought. In fact, I made this page to keep a record of reading but I will write other thing. (e.g., studying, daily life and my feeling) Thank you for visiting my page!
</p>

I am a student studying industrial engineering in university of seoul. I lived in Anyang, Gyeonggi-do. but, I'm in military service.

I'm interested in anything widely, but I don't know it very well. Recently, Finance modeling, portfolio management are of interest. Last year,I studied deep learning and reinforcement learing. So, I'm looking into the crossroads of the two areas, Quantitive finance.
I am also interested in 'Law' and 'Start-up'. Now, I'm going to study English hard, which I feel is lacking a lot. 

Thank you for reading~!
